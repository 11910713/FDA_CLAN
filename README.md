Surgical picture semantic segmentation is attracting increasing attention from
the medical image processing community. The goal generally is not to precisely
locate tools in images, but rather to indicate which tools are being used by the
surgeon at each instant. The main motivation for annotating tool usage is to
design efficient solutions for surgical workflow analysis. Analyzing the surgical
workflow has potential applications in report generation, surgical training, and
even real-time decision support.
